The current state of the race is fascinating.  
	
	1. We have a strong economy, even though many don't feel that way.
	2. Unemployment is near historical lows.
	3. Inflation is back down to roughly where the Fed target is.  Also, short of a severe 	
	recession or depression, prices are not going back to where they were before the 
	recent inflation spike.
	4. Gas prices have remained far below the pace of inflation.
	5. Border crossings are the lowest they've been in years and violent crime has fallen 		
	to historic lows.  
	
What is so interesting is that with all that said, solely because of the recent bout of inflation and immigration surge, if it was Nikki Haley or any other sane Republican, I'm convinced the Democrats would be getting trounced right now.  But Republicans decided to nominate Trump for a third time and thus have a seriously close election on their hands.  Republicans have only themselves to blame if Trump, once again, lets them down.
