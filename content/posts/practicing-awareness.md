I really enjoy the work of Aaron Ross Powell. His work for liberty has been tireless for many years and he has had some wise words about the election. I want to highlight this [blog post](https://www.aaronrosspowell.com/p/don-t-turn-away "Don't Turn Away") of his in how to approach the coming period where the freedom of minorities and the vulnerable may be under threat. We need awareness, mindful awareness, and compassionate awareness. The cause of pushing freedom for ALL people never ends. Remember, it’s not about ME. Don’t tread on ANYONE!
