One of the things I want to use this blog for is documenting my thoughts and feelings over the next four years of the Trump presidency. Obviously there is much to be uncertain of as we ultimately don't know what he is going to do. As Matt Yglesias has pointed out in his latest newsletter at [Slow Boring](slowboring.com) Trump is a liar and his followers know he is a liar and that is part of the reason they like him.  I think that a lot of his policies will be bad for the economy and our civic culture.  But I'm also concerned as someone who serves in the military with his foreign policy and how that will impact my life and the life of my family.  

Today he is expected to sign close to or more than 100 executive orders.  Doing everything from declaring national emergencies at the border and energy to changing the names of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and Mt. Denali to Mt. McKinley.  Makes me think of Governors of Maine LePage and Mills trading over what the sign at the border of Maine and New Hampshire on I-95 says.  Thankfully he also clarified for everyone that there are only two genders, male and female (hopefully the sarcasm there can be detected).  The big item that the news media seems to be taking is Trump saying that his inauguration brings to end a period of American decline.  

I should say up front that my biggest concerns are less about Trump making himself into an authoriatrian dictator, and more that our political institutions will corrupt from within and the free culture that we  have known that is based on our political system will slowly deteriorate.  Granted that this has been happening off and on for a while, having a bunch of very rich dudes able to basically manipulate our system with money, while others exploit the people seems like a recipe for disaster.  Oligarchy combined with kleptocracy is how many republics have met their fate.  Hopefully by keeping our eyes open and thinking through what is happening we can arrest the rot that threatens to overwhelm the system.  

That being said, I don't think this has to mean the end of the American experiment in self-governance.  This country has gone through many dark periods in the past and I see no reason why it could not emerge from this as well.  I also don't want to just offer up cynical takes either and disparage everything the new administration does.  I want to tell the truth as I see it with full honesty.  That is what any thinking person ought to offer at this time where there will be so much lying and deceit.
