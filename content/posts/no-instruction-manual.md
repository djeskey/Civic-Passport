<p>One of the things that I have learned over the years is how when it comes to the Bible is that there is no instruction manual for how it is to be handled. Any framework that is place on the Bible for interpretation is necessarily extra-Biblical. This is not a condemnation of frameworks that people use for Biblical interpretation, but it is a plead for people to recognize that there are many different ways to understand the Bible, and no one right single way. </p>

<p>This is a fundamental problem though with sola scripture. Scripture cannot be understood alone, but it is always filtered through culture, community (tradtion), and experience. We cannot escape that and it would be a mistake to think otherwise.The Bible is messy with contradictions, errors, and arguments within its pages. How we handle that is up to us. Sorry Catholics, but there is no final arbiter, and if you do say the magisterium, that is your choice. </p>

<p>This is where the work of someone like Peter Enns is so helpful. Scripture is a book of wisdom to help us understand what it means/looks like to live a life of faithfulness to God. It is not there to be a textbook of science and history. The Bible for Normal People has been indispensable for me in my own faith journey.
